Not in a working state yet -- don't use this to inform your trading decisions.

This is a Cryptocurrency exchange exploration tool that searches multiple markets to find the 
most advantageous trade route from one location to another. It uses the Java library XChange
(https://knowm.org/open-source/xchange/) created by Tim Molter as a generic API to accesss
many exchanges using a common interface.

More coming soon. This is in a very messy state while I try a number of things out, remove 
commented-out code from when I was learning to use XChange, and so on. In the near future 
most files will be removed or rewritten, comments will be updated, style will be unified 
across sources, and Seeker will provide actionable information.
